Repository for the Cambridge Digital Humanities Workshop: Harvesting Data and Visualising Cultural Transmission

January 30 & February 6, 2023

This repository holds the code for the first session section on Web-scraping. It utilizes the Fitzwilliiam Museum Database (https://github.com/FitzwilliamMuseum).
The Museum has an API that can be used but for the purposes of the workshop, we web-scrap to show the utility of web-scraping.

[This will be filled in later with more information about the folders and the practical]
